We are pleased to announce that the gem5 project will be participating in this
year's [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). Season
of Docs is a program, run by Google, with the goal of fostering collaboration
between open source projects and technical writers.

In this blog post we shall outline who we are and what kind of projects we are
looking for technical writers to undertake. During the exploration phase (May
11th -- June 8th), we shall begin collaborating with technical writers to
flesh-out project ideas, with the goal of having a technical writer join us
later in the year to undertake their proposed project.

More general information on Season of Docs can be found at
<https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>.

# Who are we?

gem5 is an open source computer architecture simulator. The tool is used by a
number of organizations from university research labs to large
industrial players such as Google and ARM. While we have been successful in
developing a well engineered and popular product, documentation has been left
to software engineers with little technical writing experience. We therefore
wish to mentor a technical writer to improve, and expand our documentation.

The gem5 project is highly collaborative, and as such we accept contributions
from many individuals across the world. As a technical writer, you would be
joining this community, which we hope you'll find a rewarding experience.

# Interested?

For those interested in applying, we'd advise first looking through our
[current documentation](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/), in particular our
[Learning gem5](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/)
tutorial, which should give the reader a step-by-step guide on how to setup and
run gem5. We would then like to hear suggestions from technical writers on how
best our documentation may be improved.

We have noted below some projects ideas. These are by no means final. We
expect an applicant to use these as starting points in order to find
interesting work within our project. As we want to utilize technical writing
expertise as fully as possible, we encourage technical writers to
speak up and reach out if if they have any suggestions. It will be our role, as
mentors, to give technical writers the context needed to refine these ideas
into something of use to the gem5 community.

We do not expect technical writers to fully understand the ins and outs of the
gem5 project. In fact, we want technical writers to use their naivet√© to
their advantage. Our documentation has been written by those with familiarity
to the project. We thereby believe a "fresh pair of eyes" would be of benefit
in many areas. A new technical writer within the gem5 team should be able to
identify "pain points" in our documentation and help us improve them.

## Project Idea: Audit of current documentation

Our documentation has been developed over a long period of time, by different
people, with different goals. We therefore do not have a good understanding
of what areas of gem5 are documented sufficiently, and which are not. An
audit of our current documentation, and what needs further action, would be of
great benefit to the community. We can then generate a plan on how to improve
our documentation moving forward.

## Project Idea: Beginner's Guide Documentation

At present our [Learning gem5](
http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/) tutorial
documentation is our "entry point" for beginners to use gem5. We are unsure if
this documentation is sufficient, whether it should be expanded upon, or
if it should be replaced with something more concise. In this task we are
looking to have documentation which will improve how we introduce people to the
gem5 project.

Tangentially to this, our project regularly has new contributors, many
of whom need taught how to follow our contribution procedures. Typically we
direct wannabe contributors to our [contribution guidelines](
http://www.gem5.org/contributing) and our [CONTRIBUTION.md](
https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/+/refs/heads/stable/CONTRIBUTING.md)
document. As with our Learning gem5 documentation, we would like this
investigated and improved upon if need be.


## Project Idea: Improve Source-code Documentation

We currently document our codebase through [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
Like other areas of our documentation, [our Doxygen documentation](
doxygen.gem5.org) has been developed by many people, over
many years, thereby leaving much of it written in an inconsistent manner.
Furthermore, many areas of the code-base are entirely undocumented. This
project would in-part be an audit of what we have, then development of a plan
for improvement. We would also not be opposed to a technical writer beginning
work on this plan.

## Project Idea: Improve the documentation website

At present, [our documentation](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/) is created
in a Markdown/Jekyll website. We have came across some limitations with this.
In particular, is not easily navigable. Those technical writers
with some web-dev/Jekyll experience would be of great use in coming up with an
alternative way to present our documentation --- new layouts, new styles, etc.

# Mentors

A technical writers working within gem5 will be mentored by
[Dr. Bobby R. Bruce](https://www.bobbybruce.net) and [Prof. Jason Lowe-Power](
https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/lowepower/), both of who are situated
in the University of California, Davis. Please take note of the California
time-zone (assume standard 9AM to 5PM work hours) and how this would work for
you. We are willing accept applicants from anywhere in the world. Work does
not need to occur during California work hours, but virtual meetings will be
regular.

If interested in working on gem5, please contact Dr. Bruce at "bbruce -at-
ucdavis.edu" during the Season of Docs exploration phase (May 11th -- June
8th). Dr. Bruce can help you flesh out your ideas prior to submitting an
official application. More information on the Season of Docs application
process can be found on the [Season of Docs website](
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).
